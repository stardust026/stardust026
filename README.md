# Hi, I'm Steven Zhang (Chenchen Zhang) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a recent graduate with a Master's in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Vancouver. I love solving complex problems and have developed projects in areas like web development, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), data visualization, and algorithm optimization.

## 🚀 Personal Projects

### 🔍 [Financial Report Retrieval with Graph RAG](https://github.com/stardust026/FinancialReport_RAG)
- **Technologies**: Python, Neo4j, LLamaIndex, GPT-4
- Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes SEC Form 10-K financial reports.
- Implemented an optimized data retrieval pipeline, achieving 85% answer correctness and 90% retrieval accuracy.

### 🚗 [Reachability Queries for Electric Vehicles](https://github.com/stardust026/BRIOCHE_app)
- **Technologies**: Python, Matplotlib, Scipy, Pandas, Folium
- Built an interactive map application to generate electric vehicle reachability maps based on user input.
- Developed a power consumption model with an error rate under 5% compared to mainstream APIs, improving map accuracy.

### 📦 [Best Route for Amazon Delivery](https://github.com/stardust026/TSP-AmazonDelivery)
- **Technologies**: Python, Matplotlib, Numpy, Folium
- Applied genetic algorithms to predict the shortest path for Amazon deliveries, significantly improving algorithm efficiency.
- Visualized optimized delivery routes with map plotting for intuitive data presentation.

### 📚 [Database Mining Project](https://github.com/stardust026/Sales_Transactions)
- **Technologies**: MySQL, SQLite, R, XML
- Managed large-scale sales data with MySQL and SQLite, and implemented a snowflake schema database for efficient storage.
- Utilized XPath for automating the population of SQL servers with sales data.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
- Advanced techniques in machine learning and data analysis.
- Enhancing my skills with large language models (LLMs) and scalable system architectures.
- Preparing my ACCA Audit and Assurance exam
